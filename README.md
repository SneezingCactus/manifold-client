This repository contains the Manifold **client mod**, which allows joining Manifold servers with ease.

You can find the server repository [here](https://github.com/SneezingCactus/manifold-server).

Manifold is an open-source implementation of the [bonk.io](https://bonk.io/) multiplayer servers made to allow complete freedom over the backend, making certain features possible, such as unlimited max players, unbanning, and ratelimit configuration.
